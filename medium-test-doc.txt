DEFENSE SYSTEMS BRIEFING - NAVAL AND AVIATION PROGRAMS

NAVAL SURFACE WARFARE

DDG-51 Arleigh Burke Class Destroyer Program

The Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer program represents the backbone of the U.S. Navy's surface combatant fleet. In August 2023, the Navy awarded contracts valued at approximately $14.5 billion to HII Ingalls Shipbuilding and General Dynamics Bath Iron Works for construction of ten Flight III destroyers under a five-year multiyear procurement agreement. These advanced warships are overseen by PEO Ships.

The Flight III configuration incorporates the Raytheon AN/SPY-6(V)1 Air and Missile Defense Radar, which provides 30 times greater sensitivity than the legacy AN/SPY-1D radar system. This advanced radar system integrates with the Aegis Baseline 10 combat system, developed by Lockheed Martin to provide enhanced ballistic missile defense capabilities.

In June 2024, RTX Corporation's Raytheon division received a $677.7 million contract from the Navy for AN/SPY-6(V) radar hardware production. HII Ingalls Shipbuilding, located at Pascagoula, Mississippi, serves as one of two shipyards constructing these vessels, while General Dynamics Bath Iron Works operates from Bath, Maine.

The Aegis combat system, developed by Lockheed Martin, provides integrated command and control functionality. The platform requires the MK 41 Vertical Launching System for missile deployment.

F-35 LIGHTNING II PROGRAM

The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program achieved a significant milestone on March 12, 2024, when the F-35A variant received approval for full rate production. Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Company, operating from Fort Worth, Texas, serves as the prime contractor for airframe development and production. In July 2024, Lockheed Martin delivered the 1,000th F-35 to the Wisconsin Air National Guard's 115th Fighter Wing at Truax Field.

Pratt & Whitney, a subsidiary of RTX Corporation located in East Hartford, Connecticut, manufactures the F135 engine that powers all F-35 variants. In August 2025, Pratt & Whitney received a $2.8 billion contract for Lot 18 F135 engine production.

BAE Systems supplies approximately 15 percent of F-35 components, with production facilities located in the United Kingdom. BAE Systems developed the AN/ASQ-239 Barracuda electronic warfare system. Northrop Grumman manufactures the center fuselage at facilities in Palmdale and El Segundo, California.

The F-35A variant serves Air Force requirements for tactical air superiority and strike missions. The F-35B provides the Marine Corps with short takeoff and vertical landing capability. The F-35C features strengthened landing gear for carrier operations for the Navy. All three variants share the AN/APG-81 AESA radar developed by Northrop Grumman.

PRECISION STRIKE SYSTEMS

JASSM and LRASM Programs

Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control develops and produces the Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM) family and the Long Range Anti-Ship Missile (LRASM) at facilities in Alabama. In August 2024, the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center at Eglin Air Force Base awarded Lockheed Martin a $130 million contract modification to increase production from 550 missiles annually to 1,000 missiles per year.

JASSM-ER provides extended range strike capability for Air Force and allied aircraft. LRASM represents an evolution of JASSM-ER technology, specifically designed for anti-ship warfare missions. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) initiated LRASM development to provide the Navy and Air Force with advanced maritime strike capabilities.

LRASM incorporates a multi-mode passive RF sensor system that enables target detection without relying on external targeting data. In July 2024, the Pentagon awarded contracts totaling approximately $7.8 billion for JASSM, LRASM, and AMRAAM production, with Lockheed Martin receiving $4.3 billion. PEO Missiles and Space oversees JASSM and LRASM acquisition activities.

PATRIOT AIR DEFENSE

Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) Program

The Patriot Advanced Capability-3 Missile Segment Enhancement (PAC-3 MSE) provides the Army with advanced air and missile defense capability. In July 2024, PEO Missiles and Space and Army Contracting Command executed a $4.5 billion multiyear contract awarded to Lockheed Martin for 870 PAC-3 MSE missiles.

In November 2024, Lockheed Martin successfully demonstrated PAC-3 MSE integration with Raytheon's Lower Tier Air and Missile Defense Sensor (LTAMDS) radar system. The LTAMDS radar was developed by Raytheon Technologies to replace aging Patriot radar systems. Testing at White Sands Missile Range showed successful integration.

L3Harris Technologies supplies guidance components and mission processors that interface with the PAC-3 MSE seeker system.
