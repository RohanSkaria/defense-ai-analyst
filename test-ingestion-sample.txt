NGAD (Next Generation Air Dominance) Program Overview

The Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) program is being developed by the United States Air Force to replace the F-22 Raptor as the service's air superiority fighter. Lockheed Martin and Boeing are competing for the prime contract, with an anticipated contract award in FY2025.

Key Technologies and Systems:

The NGAD platform will integrate several advanced subsystems:
- AN/APG-85 Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar
- Advanced stealth coating materials developed by Northrop Grumman
- Next-generation engine technology from Pratt & Whitney
- Distributed aperture sensor system from Raytheon Technologies

The program is overseen by PEO Fighters & Bombers and managed under Air Combat Command. The total program cost is estimated at $28.3 billion through FY2030.

B-21 Raider Bomber Program

Northrop Grumman serves as the prime contractor for the B-21 Raider strategic bomber. The aircraft incorporates:
- Open systems architecture enabling rapid technology insertion
- Low-observable stealth technology
- Advanced battle management system
- Digital engineering throughout development

The B-21 program is overseen by PEO Strategic Systems under Air Force Global Strike Command. Initial operational capability is planned for FY2027. The program funding line PE 0207455F allocated $3.1 billion in FY2024.

Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA)

The Collaborative Combat Aircraft program aims to develop autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles that operate alongside manned fighters. General Atomics and Anduril Industries are the primary contractors developing CCA prototypes.

Key capabilities include:
- AI-enabled autonomous flight systems
- Weapons carriage of AIM-120 AMRAAM and AIM-9X missiles
- Data link integration with F-35 Lightning II
- Modular payload bay design

The CCA program depends on the Joint All-Domain Command and Control (JADC2) network for connectivity. Testing is conducted at Edwards Air Force Base in California.

Hypersonic Weapons Development

The AGM-183A Air-launched Rapid Response Weapon (ARRW) is being developed by Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control. The weapon is designed to be carried by B-52 Stratofortress and B-1B Lancer bombers.

Related programs include:
- Hypersonic Attack Cruise Missile (HACM) developed by Raytheon Technologies
- Common Hypersonic Glide Body developed jointly with the Navy
- Ground-based testing at the Arnold Engineering Development Complex

The hypersonic portfolio is managed by the Air Force Rapid Capabilities Office and supported by the Missile Defense Agency for test infrastructure.

F-35 Lightning II Modernization

The F-35 program continues with Block 4 modernization efforts. Lockheed Martin Aeronautics serves as the prime contractor with major subsystem providers including:
- Pratt & Whitney (F135 engine)
- Northrop Grumman (center fuselage and mission systems)
- BAE Systems (aft fuselage and tail)
- Elbit Systems (helmet mounted display)

Recent upgrades include:
- Technology Refresh 3 (TR-3) hardware and software baseline
- Enhanced synthetic aperture radar modes
- Upgraded electronic warfare suite
- Integration of AIM-260 Joint Advanced Tactical Missile

The program is jointly managed by the F-35 Joint Program Office representing the Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps.

Naval Air Systems

The MQ-25 Stingray unmanned aerial refueling system is being developed by Boeing for the U.S. Navy. The aircraft will operate from aircraft carriers to extend the range of carrier-based strike aircraft including the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet and F-35C.

The MQ-25 interfaces with:
- Carrier-based jet fuel distribution system
- Ship self-defense system for operations in contested environments
- Cooperative Engagement Capability for networked operations

Naval Air Systems Command oversees the program with testing conducted at Naval Air Station Patuxent River in Maryland.

Conclusion

These programs represent the future of U.S. air combat capabilities, incorporating advanced technologies in stealth, autonomy, hypersonics, and network-centric warfare. Continued funding and development are critical to maintaining air superiority against near-peer adversaries.
