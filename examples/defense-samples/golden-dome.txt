The Golden Dome initiative is a hypersonic defense program managed by the Missile Defense Agency (MDA).

Northrop Grumman and Lockheed Martin are the prime contractors for the Golden Dome interceptor system. The program focuses on developing next-generation interceptor technology to counter hypersonic threats.

Golden Dome is part of the broader Glide Phase Interceptor (GPI) program and depends on advanced sensor technology from Raytheon's SPY-7 radar.

The program reached Milestone B in FY2024 with $500M in funding allocated through PE 0603886C. Initial operational capability is planned for FY2028.

Testing will be conducted at White Sands Missile Range, with developmental testing scheduled for 2025 and operational testing in 2027.
