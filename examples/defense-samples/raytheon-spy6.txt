Raytheon Technologies provides the AN/SPY-6 Air and Missile Defense Radar (AMDR) for the DDG-51 Flight III destroyers under PEO Ships oversight.

The AN/SPY-6 radar system is a key component of the Arleigh Burke-class destroyer modernization program. It provides enhanced detection and tracking capabilities for ballistic missile defense.

Raytheon was awarded the prime contract in 2013. The first AN/SPY-6 radar was delivered in 2020 and installed on USS Jack H. Lucas (DDG-125), the first Flight III destroyer.

PEO Ships manages the DDG-51 program and coordinates with Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) for integration and testing.

The radar system underwent developmental testing at the Pacific Missile Range Facility and operational testing in 2021, achieving Milestone C approval.
